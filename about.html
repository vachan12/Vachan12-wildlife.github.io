                    WWF does not single out individual animals, or families, for adoption. 
                    Your donation is directed to field programs 
                    to support science, research, and animal study. 
                    The adoption is symbolic in the sense that many animals benefit from your generous support
                    You are saving a life
                    Unconditional love.</p>
